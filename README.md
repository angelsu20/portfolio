## Project Experience
### Bikes & Cycling Accessories Organization's Transactions Data Based Cohort Analysis
The project encompassed an in-depth cohort analysis of transaction data for a Bikes & Cycling Accessories Organization during a KPMG virtual internship. Key steps included data extraction from API sources via Unix command lines, followed by data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. This process revealed key insights from bicycle transactions. The developed cohort analysis provided a comprehensive visualization of the organization's business KPIs through heatmaps. A significant component was the calculation of the retention rate on a monthly basis, aimed at determining the crucial factors influencing customer behavior. This comprehensive data analysis project offered essential insights that can guide the organization's strategic decisions in terms of customer retention and product marketing.

This project involved the creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard that provided a comprehensive exploration and visualization of hotel booking data. The dashboard included various data visualizations such as geospatial maps, histograms, and bar charts, highlighting the major factors influencing hotel pricing. In addition to the visual representation, time series analysis was utilized to determine seasonal trends in traveler booking patterns and hotel prices. This helped identify key drivers of pricing changes, thereby enabling users to make data-driven decisions for optimal hotel reservations. The project delivered a user-friendly tool for understanding hotel booking dynamics, facilitating more informed decision-making based on clear insights and trends.

### Diabetes Prediction Dataset

Conducted a variety of supervised machine learning models including logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, naive Bayes, K-NN, MLP, random forest, and boosted tree models to predict the onset of diabetes based on medical and demographic factors using a Kaggle diabetes dataset. Preprocessing pipelines were developed for machine learning model optimization, incorporating hyperparameter optimization with GridSearch, SMOTE oversampling, and K-fold cross-validation. The project significantly employed explainable AI metrics such as permutation importance, feature importance, Shapley values, partial dependence plots, surrogate models, Shapley Value (Local), and Individual Conditional Expectation plots to determine the public health factors contributing most to the increased risk of diabetes. Based on the feature importance metrics, early detection screening protocols were created for patients at high risk for diabetes. The outcome was an effective tool for predicting diabetes onset and a protocol for early intervention in high-risk individuals.

### Loan Eligibility Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithm

This project focused on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict loan eligibility based on applicant demographics, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Initial phases included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and correlation analysis to extract key insights. Machine learning classification models, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest, were developed in R to predict loan eligibility based on the details of the applicants. The performance of these models was then compared to select the most effective prediction tool. This project, hence, resulted in a robust system capable of accurately predicting loan eligibility, thereby assisting financial institutions in decision-making processes related to loan approvals.

## Work Experience
- Data Analyst @ Vegenius Restaurant Taiwan (2021-2022)

Conducted trend analysis among the youth population was utilized to strategically enter and expand the business's presence in the vegetarian market. The successful implementation of this data-driven approach led to significant growth, manifesting in the acquisition of 20,000 likes and followers on the restaurant's Facebook fan page. Further enhancing the restaurant's popularity among young adults and non-vegetarian diners was achieved through the use of Facebook analytics and the creation of diner surveys. The project effectively demonstrated the power of data analytics in identifying market trends and driving targeted business expansion in the vegetarian restaurant industry.
